FIX The following actions cause datafile corruption:
       cdaut, cdaut, del, save 
  
  
From Francois:
FIX:   When I asked to "save filename" 
      (eg: save test-console.ged), it saved the file, but
       not with the filename I asked, but with the name 
       "filename".
  
FIX: The gedcom file I was working on with genj-textmode, 
      was encoded using "ansel". It saved the file not
      using "ansel", but "unicode". I would have liked it to
      keep the encoding schema used originally.
