<body>

<a href=./Report.html>Reports</a> are simple, plug-able Java Types 
which are executed in the context of GenealogyJ. They can access the 
underlying object representation of Gedcom-file opened by the user. 

<h2>Running Reports</h2>

<p>There are multiple ways of intergrating a report with GenJ. Generally every 
report found in the report-directory (or one of its sub-directories) will be
loaded and displayed in ReportView. There the user can read about the
report's author and operation description, set report-options and run 
them individually. </p>

<p>A report can also be run by opening the context-menu for a Gedcom element
in the UI. Depending on the selected element (for example an entity, a
property or a Gedcom-file itself) reports that can accept this context as
input are presented. A report declares whether it can run on a given
context by overriding 
 <pre> public String accepts(Object context) </pre>
and returning a textual description of the action the report will do if
executed (if applicable). By default it's assumed that reports can be
executed on a <a href=../gedcom/Gedcom.html>Gedcom</a> object - when
run the report is called with a reference to an instance of the corresponding
type.
