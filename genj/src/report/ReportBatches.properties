info      = <h1><center>Batch of reports</center></h1>
 <p>
  Run a batch of your favorite reports.
  Or run with a saved configuration to restore the options.
 </p>
 <p>
  Search the <a href="http://genj.sourceforge.net/forum">forums</a> 
  for the alternative: ReportRunner. It has its own (dis)advantages.
 </p>
 <h2>Options</h2>
 <p>
  The check box to generate the configuration files is not persistent.
  First configure and test the reports one by one, 
  then simply run ReportBatches twice to test them all in one go.
 </p>
 <h2>Configuration files</h2>
 <p>
  Configuration files look like the options panel of the reports.
  The files have an additional line for the entity ID's 
  to use as context for the reports.
 </p>
 <p>
  No configuration file is generated for your favorite report? 
  Locate its java file, and  place "implements BatchCompatible" after "extends Report"
  recompile the reports, check the option to generate configuration files again and try your luck.
 </p>
 <h2>Dialogs per report</h2>
 <p>
  Individual reports may ask for things like output filenames.
  Move the dialog out of the report panel 
  to examine the logged info that identifies the current report.
 </p>
