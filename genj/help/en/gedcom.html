<H2>Gedcom</H2>

<P>
Gedcom is a standard for exchanging genealogic information in an electronic 
format. It is similiar to XML in it's structure but it's not quite as well defined. 
</P>

<P>
Generally all Gedcom information is hierarchically structured. An entity
(like Person, Family or Note) is comprised of a tree of properties without
a inherent limit on the number of levels. Beside the standard well-defined
properties (like Date, Name, Sex, etc.) it is possible to handle custom 
or special properties unknown to the application handling Gedcom correctly.
</P>

<P>
Since Gedcom doesn't know the notion of closing and ending Tags (like XML)
it is based on lines of different indentation. Indentation is specified
by a number - then follows the Tag identifying the property type.
Here is an example (sub-properties are indented here for readability only):

  1 NOTE @N003@
</PRE>

<P>
Special properties have a certain format for the contained data (e.g. Name /Last Name/).
Some properties reference other entities - here the property NOTE links to
a note with id N003 in the same Gedcom file.
</P>

<P>
The power of GenealogyJ is that it allows this nested information to
be edited in its hierarchical form. All known properties are treated in a
way that offers specific input for editing - no need to look at a text-file.
Since GenJ knows about properties which reference entities, it handles the 
referential integrity and allows for easy construction of relationships
(like adding a child to a parent or adding a spouse to an individual).
GenJ knows about the Gedcom standard and will suggest sub-properties to add 
to properties if desired. You don't have to know Gedcom to use GenJ but
it will help you understand why things are the way they are. You might
appreciate that your data is fully exchangeable with other Gedcom compliant 
applications.

The current Gedcom version supported by GenJ is
