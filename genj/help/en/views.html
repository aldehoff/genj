<h2>Working with Views</h2>

<p>
 Once you've opened a file containing genealogic information in Gedcom
 format (*.ged) through <a href="cc.html">Control Center</a> you can 
 open views on it.
</p>

<p>
 Views all work on the same underlying data - this means that
 <ul>
  <li>changes performed in one view immediately become effective in 
     other views on the same file
  <li>selection events from one view propagate to the other views 
     on the same file*
  <li>closing a file will close all views on that file
  <li><a href="./context.html">context-menues</a> bind actions from
     all views on the same file into one place
 </ul>
 <p align=right><font size=-2>
    *changes in selection to one view might not trigger a change in
     another if the latter cannot follow the selection
 </font></p>
</p>

<p>
 Typically you will open one instance per type of view - not necessarily
 all but combinations that help to navigate and understand the underlying
 data. For example
 <ul>
  <li>Tree&Table View to browse the existing information
  <li>Table&Edit View to cleanup, catalog and edit the existing information
  <li>Report View to run reports on large files
 </ul>
</p>

<p>
 The combination is not limited and you'll soon get a feeling for which 
 combination of views fullfills your needs. The views will remember the 
 position and size of the enclosing windows so position them as required
 and they will pop-up at the same place next time. You can also open
 several instances of the same view to check out different angles - in
 that case they're numbered sequentially.
</p>

<p>
 Here now is the list of views at your disposal:
 <blockquote>
  <img src="../images/views/Table.gif"    >&nbsp;<A href="./view/table.html"    >Table View    </A><br>
  <img src="../images/views/Tree.gif"     >&nbsp;<A href="./view/tree.html"     >Tree View     </A><br>

  <img src="../images/views/Edit.gif"     >&nbsp;<A href="./view/edit.html"     >Edit View     </A><br>
  <img src="../images/views/Report.gif"   >&nbsp;<A href="./view/report.html"   >Report View   </A><br>
  <img src="../images/views/Navigator.gif">&nbsp;<A href="./view/navigator.html">Navigator View</A><br>
