<Font color="red"><b>Q</b></Font> - You wanted to show a picture for 
every person in the main <A Href="./../view/tree.html">tree view</A> ?
  <Ul><Font color="green"><b>A</b></Font> - 
You can do that by either:<Br>
+ adding a OBJE-property to an individual which can have a FILE
  property referring to a file or a BLOB property that includes
  the file's content (the editor will show a 'choose file'
  dialog for this)<Br>
+ select the individual so that it shows up in the Editor and
  click on the button in the lower/right corner 
	(*<A Href="./../entity/media.html">Media</A>)
  This will create a new multimedia entry that is linked to
  the individual.<Br>
The first case let's you choose that property in the tree-settings 
window so that all that shows in the entities box.
(The default Gedcom supplied with the distribution does
 that for a picture from Nils Meier btw)
