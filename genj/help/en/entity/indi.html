<P>
Gedcom information mostly revolves about individuals. That's you, your father,
your children and any other ancestor or descendant. By clicking on the small
symbol <img src="../../images/Indi.gif"></img> in the <A href="../cc.html">Control Center</A>
you can very easily enter new information for individuals you know about.
</P>

<P>
The creation asks for given, family name and sex. Then you can specify its
relationship to your existing data. First select any family or individual
in the <A href="../view/tree.html">Tree View</A> or 
<A href="../view/table.html">Table View</A>. The radiobuttons below the
indication of the selected entity allows to specify the new relationship.
When selecting an individual the new one can be its Sibling, Child, Parent
(if not already exists) or Spouse. When selecting a family the new individual
can be Child or Spouse. Make your selection and click on Create.
</P>

<P>
When editing an Individual in the <A href="../view/edit.html">Edit View</A>
you should stick to the Gedcom standard as close as possible. A typical
individual could consists of this kind of information:
<PRE>
@I008@ INDI
 NAME Nils /Meier/
 SEX M
 BIRT
  DATE 25 MAY 1970
  PLAC Rendsburg, Germany
 RESI
  ADDR 202-1241 Kilborn Place
  DATE FROM 30 JUL 1999 TO 2000     
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
Just work through the properties of your individuals and change
their properties. When adding new properties choose from the 
predefined list or if necessary extend the schema by adding
new property-tags for special user-properties.
</P>

<P>
An important feature of Gedcom is the capability to link
entities. Individuals are normally not separate - they are
married, have parents and children. Everytime you create a
new Individual related to others, they are linked through
properties. These properties for the individuals are
FAMC (being a child in a family)or FAMS (being a spouse in
a family). The properties refer to the family by its
id. You can explore the relationship between individuals
and families by following those links. Be careful when
deleting or creating new links - keeping the overview
of the referential integrity is not easy :). 
</P>

<P>
Assume a special case as an example: You have your family
tree and found out that an ancestors wife's sister married
his brother. All those individuals are in your tree already!
You can now create a new <A>family</A> for this newly
discovered relationship. But then you don't want to create a new
individual - you want to link existing entities!
The solution: Select your ancestor's brother and add a FAMS
property to it. Then change it to point to the new family
by entering its ID. Click on the link-button and a HUSB property 
will automatically be added to that family. The circle is made.
