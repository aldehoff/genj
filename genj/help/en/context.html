<h2>Working with Context Menues</h2>

<p>
 The most important thing to try while working with GenJ is triggering
 the context-menues. A right-click <font size=-2>(your platform might 
 have a different mouse action to trigger them)</font> on the information 
 displayed in one of the <a href="./views.html">views</a> will reveal 
 actions you can take.
</p>

<p>
 The context-menu always is structured the same way : at first place it 
 shows a sub-menu for what you have clicked on and then subsequentially
 more sub-menues that broaden the context. 
</p>

<p>
 In the following example the context for a Name-property is shown. 
 The first sub-menu is for the property itself and actions on it, the 
 second sub-menu is for the entitiy (here an Individual) this property 
 belongs to, the third sub-menu is for the file (Gedcom) the entity belongs to. 
  <blockquote><img src="../images/screenshots/context1.png"></blockquote>
 The sub-menu for the Individual 'I008' shows the following actions:
 <ul>
  <li>Add Child - a child (and family if necessary) for I008
  <li>Add Spouse - a spouse (and family if necessary) for I008
  <li>Add Sibling - a sibling (and parents if necessary) for I008
  <li>Add Repository - a external repository with information concerning I008
  <li>Add Multimedia Object - an object storing binary data 
  <li>Add Note - a note describing I008
  <li>Add Submitter - the person who submitted the information about I008
  <li>Add Source - the source for information about I008
  <li>Add Association - an association with another Individual
  <li>Delete - to remove the entity I008
 </ul>
</p>

<p>
 The next example again shows a context-menu for a property but this time
 the actions for the property itself are shown (first sub-menu).
  <blockquote><img src="../images/screenshots/context3.png"></blockquote>
 These are the actions offered:
 <ul>
  <li>Add Note - this note can keep data specific to that birth
  <li>Add Source - this source can capture where the information about the birth came from
  <li>Add Multimedia Object - this object can store binary data that concerns the birth
  <li>Delete - remove the information about the birth (property BIRT) completely
 </ul>
</p>


<p>
 Lastly an example which shows the dynamic content of the context-menues.
 The special circumstances explained:
 <ul>
  <li>the context being clicked on isn't a property but an entity 
    (here Individual I008) so no sub-menu for a property is shown
    (first sub-menu is the one for Individual I008)
  <li>a context-menu can be used by the current view to
    offer special view-dependent actions - here it's 
      <a href="./view/tree.html">Tree View</a>'s
    <em>Add Bookmark</em>
 </ul>
  <blockquote><img src="../images/screenshots/context2.png"></blockquote>
 The actions shown in the opened sub-menu allow to create un-related/referenced* 
 entities in file example.ged .
 
 <p align=right><font size=-2>
 it's better to grow information and create entities that are related to
 existing ones through the first (two) sub-menues
 </font></p>
