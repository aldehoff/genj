<H2>Tools</H2>

<P>
There are currently two tools hooked up in the main menubar. 
</P>

<P>
<H3>Verify Gedcom</H3>
This tool verifies a Gedcom file - first choose the file to
check for compliancy. Then choose from the given options
which should be checked (might not be changeable for now).
</P>

<P>
<H3>Merge Gedcoms</H3>
This tool merges two Gedcom files - first choose the file to
be read from. Then choose the file to perform the merge into.
After clicking OK those files will be merged and you can
see the results in the latter file.
</P>
</P>
You have to be very careful when merging files because
overlapping id information will be matched when GenJ tries to
identify information that matches!
