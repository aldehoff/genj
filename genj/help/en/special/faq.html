<a name = "1"><p>
  <b>Q</b> What is GenJ all about?<br>
  <b>A</b> GenealogyJ (in short GenJ) is a viewer and editor for genealogic data stored in Gedcom format.
</p>

<a name = "2"><p>
  <b>Q</b> Is there a discussion forum devoted to GenJ ?<br>
  <b>A</b> Yes, please go to our
    <a href="http://genj.sourceforge.net/forum">forum @ genj.sourceforge.net</a>
<p>

<a name = "3"><p>
 <b>Q</b> What does Gedcom stand for?<br>
 <b>A</b> Please read the explanation <a href="./../concepts/gedcom.html">here</A>.
</p>

<a name = "4"><p>
 <b>Q</b> How do I get pictures to show up in Tree View?<br>
 <b>A</b> 
 To show a picture for every person in the main Tree view add
 a multimedia property (OBJE) to your individuals. Simply bring
 up an indivdual in <a href="../view/edit.html">Edit View</a>, choose the topmost
 property INDI, click on '+' and choose OBJE to be added.
 Point the sub-property FILE to a file in your computer's 
 file-system (button '>>') and the images will be picked up by 
 <a href="../view/tree.html">Tree View</a> (it's looking
 for INDI:OBJE:FILE automatically).
</p>

<a name = "5"><p>
 <b>Q</b> Can I change the language that GenJ speaks?<br>
 <b>A</b> 
  Please download the appropriate language pack (genj_ll-x.y.zip) for GenJ
  (e.g. genj_fr-2.0.zip) from the 
    <a target=project href="http://genj.sourceforge.net">project's homepage</a>
  and follow the instructions described to install it. 
  GenJ will try to use the language of your operating system automatically. 
  To explicitly switch to a language (the language pack has to been installed 
  manually) 
  choose menu-item <em>Help|About</em> and flip to the <em>Look&Feel</em>-Tab.
  Then select the language of choice.
</p>

<a name = "6"><p>
 <b>Q</b> Can I make a centimeter look like one on my screen?<br>
 <b>A</b> GenJ uses real-world metrics for various components (e.g. in
  <a href="../view/tree.html">Tree View</a>). To make lengths of lines and
  sizes of boxes appear correctly on your screen you'll have to tell GenJ
  about your display's resolution (which is reported by the operating system
  but normally doesn't match system's monitor). 
  To explicitly adjust the resolution 
  choose menu-item <em>Help|About</em> and flip to the <em>Look&Feel</em>-Tab. 
  Then use a ruler to match the shown rulers on your screen.
</p>

<a name = "7"><p>
 <b>Q</b> Can I change the boring gray look?<br>
 <b>A</b> GenJ uses the Swing Toolkit for presenting information to the
 user. This by default looks gray - it's called <em>Metal</em>. GenJ
 allows to change the current Look&Feel. 
 Please download the Look&Feel pack (genj_lnf-x.y.zip) from the
    <a target=project href="http://genj.sourceforge.net">project's homepage</a>
  and follow the instructions described to install it. 
  After restarting GenJ
  choose menu-item <em>Help|About</em> and flip to the <em>Look&Feel</em>-Tab. 
  Now you can select a Look&Feel (and optionally a Theme).

<a name = "8"><p>
 <b>Q</b> I have an existing person and I want to make it a child of 
 another existing person. The only available options I can see is to 
 add a *new* child/parent to an existing record, but there doesn't seem 
 to be an option to add an *existing* person as a child/parent. How do 
 I do this?<br>
 <b>A</b> You can go to the 'existing' parent (or the parental family 
 for the 'existing' child). Then choose "Add Child" from context menu 
 and in the following dialog choose the person of your choice from the 
 drop-down box at the top.<Br>
 This way no new person will be created as child but a relationship to 
 the 'existing' one is built.
</p>
<a name = "9"><p>
 <b>Q</b> How do I add the ADOP(tion) property in the right way?<br>
 <b>A</b> For the person you want to add the relationship to, add the person as a child of the adopted family: go to the FAM(ily) entity, select "Family => Add Child", and select the person to add as an adopted child from the drop down menu. This will put the FAMC property on the person's INDI entity. Next, go to the INDI entity for the person and create the ADOP property on the INDI entity. Next drag and drop (or cut/paste in 2.2+MDI version) the FAMC property from being under the INDI to being under the ADOP property. To specify who adopted the child, select the nested FAMC property that was just moved in the Edit INDI view and add an ADOP property to it. Select the newly created ADOP property and a new option will appear in the edit window to select the person who adopted the child: (HUSB=husband, or male spouse of the FAMily; WIFE=wife, or female spouse of the FAMily; BOTH=both the spouses adopted the child).
</p>
<a name = "10"><p>
 <b>Q</b> Why do size and resolution of images changed during program usage?<br>
 <b>A</b> The blueprints do play a role in the outcome of the rendering. Depending on how much has to be shown in a box the space for an image can be limited. It will be shrunk to make space for the text. If there's enough space then the image uses up to it's real dimensions (pixel dimensions *and* resolution) space. That's why they can look different.
