<H2>ResEdit - The Resource Editor</H2>

<P>
This is an external program to GenJ made to translate the resource
files to another language (eg. to translate them into french). 
</P>

<P>
<H3>What do you need to run it?</H3>
First of all, you have to create a startup file named for example
<i>resedit</i> (if you run Linux), or <i>resedit.cmd</i> (if you 
run OS/2), etc...
</P>

<P>
In it, put the following commands (this example is given for Linux,
but change it to match your system, of course) :

To start the resource editor, all you have to do now is to run
your startup file you've just created by typing "resedit".<Br>
After clicking on the OPEN button once started up, please select 
an input archive, <i>(eg. genj.jar)</i> - but see N.B. below.<Br> 
Then either translate the existing texts by loading a TRANSLATION 
or go through texts manually.<Br>
In the second case, you have to select a node on the left (corresponds 
to a directory) to start the translation. Then choose resource lines 
on the right and enter the translation in the input line at the bottom.<Br>
If you want to load a translation, click on the translate icon on
the main menu, then select the translation file you want to 
edit/modify (<i>eg. genj_fr.zip</i>). Once selected, uncheck the 
option "Default locale or ..." and choose the appropriate locale 
(in my example, I have to choose "<i>fr</i>"). Once done, you have to  
click on the translate button.

<Ul>
	<b>N.B.</b> Starting from GenJ v. 1.7 and Resedit 0.02, it's better to open 
	the <i>genj_en.zip</i> file instead of <i>genj.jar</i>. So click first
	on the open button, then select genj_en.zip, once done, click on the
	translate button, and select the translation file you want to edit/modify.
	etc...(see above).<Br>

After translating the resource lines, you can SAVE the resulting
archive to a ZIP or JAR file. You have to specify which locale you
are referring to, during LOAD, TRANSLATE or SAVE. This corresponds
to a resources_xyz.properties file schema which is then used by
the application loading these resources. The name of the files
you load and save is not important for Java - the locale you choose
is used inside the language archive only. For organizing the
files it's simply easier to identify them as genj_XY.zip (where
XY is the contained locale - eg : genj_fr.zip).<Br>

	<Tr>

			<dd>-&nbsp;For Java 1.1: You must have a swing.jar 
			library in your classpath.
		</Td>
	</Tr>
	<Tr>
		<Td>		
			<dd>-&nbsp;And I saw that to have Resedit (v. 0.01) to work, 
			the genj.jar and genj_XY.zip files must be located in 
			your main GenJ directory, not in your /genj/lib subdirectory.

<P>
<H3>What files are available?</H3>
Actually, those resource files are available :
<Ul>
	<li> <b>Dutch</b> resource file : not yet
	<li> <b>English</b> resource file : genj_en.zip
	<li> <b>French</b> resource file : genj_fr.zip
	<li> <b>German</b> resource file : genj_de.zip
	<li> <b>Italian</b> resource file : soon
</Ul>
<font size="-2">(The English, German, and French language files have been 
updated with the latest genj release)</Font>
