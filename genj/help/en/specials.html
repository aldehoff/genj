<H2>Special Information</H2>

<P>
This section contains information about special features of GenJ. The
novice user doesn't have to use them right away. Stick to entering
your genealogic information and explore all the standard features.
</P>

<P>
Once you start to work with others, exchanging files, you will want
to merge files or check the compliancy of a file. There will
probably be more special Tools like that - for now have a look
<A href="special/tools.html">here</A> to learn about the existing ones.
</P>

<P>
GenJ can run Reports on a file - but there isn't a big and sophisticated
selection yet. To learn about writing your own read on <A href="special/report.html">here</A>
- please make sure to share any reports you come up with.
</P>

<P>
To localize GenJ you can either edit one of the language-jar's content
by hand (have a look into genj_en.zip) or you can run a little ui-tool
<A href="special/resedit.html">Resedit</A>
