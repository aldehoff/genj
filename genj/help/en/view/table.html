<h2><a href="../views.html">Views</a> - Table View</h2>

<p>
This view shows all entities (of the same type) in a
tabular fashion. You can scroll up/down and select
entities. A selection is notified to the 
<A href="edit.html">Edit View</A> which will then
show that entity's properties. Click on one of the
column headers and the whole list will be sorted by
that column - click once again and the sorting is
reversed.
</p>

<p>
Individual columns represent paths to a property of 
an entity's property-tree. The column-headers show that
path - e.g. <B>INDI:BIRT:DATE</B> stands for the date of 
the birthday-property of an individual. 
</p>

<p>
The toolbar at the lower/right offers additional functionality:
<OL>
<LI>The buttons with entities' symbols choose to show either
individuals, families, medias or notes
