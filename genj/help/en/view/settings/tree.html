<H2>Tree View's Settings</H2>

<P>
You can change a great deal about how the <A href="../tree.html">Tree View</A>
represents itself. The settings dialog shows three tabs to choose
from which are described here.
</P>

<P>
Don't forget to press apply when done!

<H3>Properties</H3>
Here you specify which properties to show in the boxes in the tree. First
select a type from the combobox (e.g. Individuals). Then check all
properties you are interested in by clicking on the nodes in the
small property-tree below. Finally rearrange the properties in the
bottom box - this is a little bit tricky because you can size and
position those fields on a per-pixel basis. By moving the ruler
on the right you can setup a grid to help you with the positioning.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Options</H3>
Choose a zoom-level by clicking on the scale or turn on/off 
features from the list of options: decide whether boxes show
shadows, images for properities are shown, images are be 
zoomed (time and resource intense!) when zooming the tree and
the tree is layouted vertically or horizontally.
</P>

<P>
<H3>Bookmarks</H3>
A bookmark is a shortcut to an origin in the tree. Select an
entity in any of the views (the first line show that it know
points to that entity) and give it a name in the textfield.
Then add it to the list of bookmarks so that it will show up in the
Tree View's combobox on the lower/right. 
You can also delete and reorganize bookmarks by moving them up 
and down, placing them as convenient.
