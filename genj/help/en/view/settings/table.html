To change the column informatin shown in the <A href="../table.html">Table View</A>
select one of the entity types from the combobox at the top. Then
select properties from the small tree of properties below. Every
checked property shows up in the list at the bottom - mind that 
a property consists of a path through a hierarchy of properties.
For example <B>INDI:BIRT:DATE</B> refers to the date-property of
the birth-property of an individual. Rearrange the selected properties
(=columns) as you like by clicking on the up/down buttons on the left.
