<h2>Timeline View</h2>

<!-------- note for all views ----------------------------->
<blockquote><table border=1><tr><td>
 <b>Note:</b> All views in GenJ work on the same underlying 
 model that captures the genealogic data. You should have 
 familiarized yourself with the general concept of
   <a href="../views.html">Working with Views</a>
 before drilling down to individuals views.
</td></tr></table></blockquote>
<!--------------------------------------------------------->

<p>
The timeline shows all events stored in a Gedcom file. An event
is a special Gedcom-property like BIRTh, DEATh, RESIdence or GRADuation.
This view puts all events on a scale starting before
the first event and ending after the last event. The events are
put into a layout from left to right (and top to bottom). Scroll
around to inspect the events that happened around a specific time.

The toolbar at the lower/right offers additional functionality:
<OL>
<LI>You can choose a zoom-level by clicking on the 
zoom-widget (double-click restores 100%)
