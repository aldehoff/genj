 <p>
  As discussed in the section about <a href="../concepts/gedcom.html">Gedcom</a>
  one entity consists of a hierarchy of properties and their values.
  After opening this view it will follow any selection that you might
  make in any view in GenJ. The hierarchy of properties of the selected 
  entity will be displayed including symbols that represent each property,
  the Tags and values.
 </p>
 
 <p>
  Explore the tree of properties and use the scrollbars at the right and
  bottom if necessary. After clicking on a property an editor for that
  type of property will appear in the bottom half if applicable. Change
  values there if desired.
 </p>

 <p>
  Some of the properties contain references to other entities (e.g. HUSB keeps
  a reference of a family's husband and FAMS the reference of a spouse's family).
  Click twice on such a node and the current entity will be switched to that
  target.
 </p>
 
</td><td>

  <blockquote><img src="../../images/screenshots/edit1.png"></blockquote>

</td></tr></table>

<p>
 The plus-button in the toolbar (see below) allows to add new properties. 
 An additional property is added as a sub-property of the currently 
 selected property.
 A dialog will present all Gedcom compliant sub-properties - choose one
 or more and they're inserted. You can also add properties through custom
 Tags in the same dialog but it's advised to do so sparingly as to not
 divert too far from the standard.
</p>

<p>
 Don't forget the <a href="../concepts/context.html">Context Menu</a> to 
 perform complex actions on properties and the entity, too. 
 Try a right-click on one of the displayed nodes and discover what you can do.
