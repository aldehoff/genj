<h2><a href="../views.html">Views</a> - Tree View</h2>

<p>
It doesn't come as a surprise that genealogic data forms a 
tree - a Family Tree. GenJ looks at the origin of that tree
and displays all its ancestors and all its descendants.
One exception though : only direct descendants with their
spouses and direct ancestors with their spouses are shown.
So the brother of your grandfather becomes visible
after you make latter or any of his ancestors the origin of
the tree.
</p>

<p>
You can browse the tree by scrolling and by selecting
individuals or families. Everytime you select one of
the entities the <A href="edit.html">Edit View</A> is
notified to display it. By double-clicking on an
entity you make it the origin of the tree. After a
short recalculation the tree displays itself in the
new layout. If you want to restrict the shown information
you can remove sub-trees by clicking on the small
minus (-) / plus (+) symbols attached to the family-child
relationship line.
</p>

<p>
The toolbar at the lower/right offers additional functionality:
<OL>
<LI>You can choose from a list of bookmarks and the tree will
make that entity the origin of the tree 
<LI>You can also choose a zoom-level by clicking on the 
zoom-widget (double-click restores 100%)
<LI>The small button with the magnifying glass opens/closes a 
window with an overview of the tree allowing easier navigation
through a large structure (click and move the gray visible range)
