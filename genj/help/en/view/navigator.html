<h2>Navigator View</h2>

<!-------- note for all views ----------------------------->
<blockquote><table border=1><tr><td>
 <b>Note:</b> All views in GenJ work on the same underlying 
 model that captures the genealogic data. You should have 
 familiarized yourself with the general concept of

GenJ offers several ways to navigate through your genealogical data. You can
pick individuals and families in the <A href="./tree.html">Tree View</A>,
select entities in the <A href="./table.html">Table View</A> or browse
properties in the <A href="./edit.html">Edit View</A> and jump to other
referenced entities. As a global navigating element the Navigator View allows
you to follow relationships of individuals globally - other views will follow
and show the individual you've navigated to.

The following picture shows what the Navigator View offers with its five
buttons (description in light blue). It shows the current selected individual
at the top and the buttons arranged according to their functionality.<Br>
