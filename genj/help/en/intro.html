<P>
GenJ is a viewer and editor for genealogic data and is written in 
100% pure Java. A small team of people have contributed to this 
development and since it is released under GPL you're invited to 
download the  source code and/or join the <A href="./team.html">team</A>.
</P>

<P>
This online help gives you a head start about GenJ's features
and tells a little bit about its inner workings and hidden specials :).
Having a powerful tool for working with genealogic information like GenJ
is great but some things are not quite easy to find for the novice user.
Please read the sections about <a href="./views.html">Working with Views<a/> 
and <a href="./context.html">Working With Context Menues</a> very thoroughly 
because they cover the important basics of the main GenJ concepts.
