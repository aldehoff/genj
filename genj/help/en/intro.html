<H1>GenJ - Genealogy J</h1>

<P>
GenJ is a genealogy viewer and editor written in 100% pure Java.
A small team of people have contributed to this development and 
since it is released under GPL you're invited to download the 
source code and/or join the <A href="./team.html">team</A>.
</P>

<P>
This online help gives you a head start about GenJ's features
and tells a little bit about its inner workings and hidden specials :).
Having a powerfull editor is nice because of all its capabilities
but some things are not quite easy to find for the novice user.
Please read the section about entities very thoroughly because
it covers how to manage and enter your genealogic data.
