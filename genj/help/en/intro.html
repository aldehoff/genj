<H2>GenJ - Genealogy J</h2>

<P>
GenJ is a viewer and editor for genealogic data and is written in 
100% pure Java. A small team of people have contributed to this 
development and since it is released under GPL you're invited to 
download the  source code and/or join the <A href="./team.html">team</A>.
</P>

<P>
This online help gives you a head start about GenJ's features
and tells a little bit about its inner workings and hidden specials :).
Having a powerful tool for working with genealogic information like GenJ
is great but some things are not quite easy to find for the novice user.
Please read the section about entities very thoroughly because
it covers the basics of how this kind of data is modelled and handled 
in GenJ.
