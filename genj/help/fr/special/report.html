<H2>Report Writing</H2>

<P>
A GenJ report is a Java class that implements the interface <I>genj.report.Report</I>.
Writing your own functionality starts by defining your own class in a source-file
and placing that file into the reports-subdirectory (its name has to start with Report*).
</P>
<P>
Let's assume we want to write a test-report named "Test1". First create a text-file
named ReportTest1.java in ./reports. Then compile it by running the compile-script 
in the same directory. This script runs javac - the java compiler. The end-result is
a file named ReportTest1.class which GenJ can load and execute after it's selected
in the <A href="../view/report.html">Report View</A>.
</P>

<P>
Let's have a look at the sample ReportTest1.java. It contains one public class-definition
that conforms to the Report contract (<I>implements Report</I>). Part of that contract
is to supply behaviour for all of the following methods:
<blockquote>
<il>
<li>getName
<li>getInfo
<li>start
<li>usesStandardOut
<li>getAuthor
<li>isReadOnly
</il>
</blockquote>
See the example below or the downloadable API to learn more about what those methods
are there for. The most important one is <I>start</I> - it's the main entrypoint into
the report's logic:

 <PRE>

  import genj.gedcom.*;
  import genj.report.*;
  import java.io.*;

  /**
   * A report named Foo
   */
  public class ReportFoo implements Report {

    /**
     * The name of the report
     */
    public String getName() {
      return "Foo";
    }

    /**
     * Information about the report
     */
    public String getInfo() {
      return "This report is oh so good\nPlease try it now!";
    }

    /**
     * The main entry point for the report
     */
    public boolean start(ReportBridge bridge, Gedcom gedcom) throws InterruptedException {

      bridge.println("Hello World");

      return true;
    }

    /**
     * Whether this report uses StandardOut or its own windows/dialogs
     */
    public boolean usesStandardOut() {
      return true;
    }

    /**
     * The author of this report
     */
    public String getAuthor() {
      return "Nils Meier <nils@meiers.net>";
    }

    /**
     * Whether this report will change the Gedcom data it is running on
     */
    public boolean isReadOnly() {
      return false;
    }
  }
 </PRE>
</P>

<P>
Inside the start-method all the information in the Gedcom-object can be accessed.
You will have to download the GenJ API (a HTML class reference) to explore the 
possibilities captured in the GenJ core-classes. For starters you should try to
extend the already existing reports.
