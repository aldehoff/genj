  <b>Q</b> What is GenJ all about?<br>
  <b>A</b> GenealogyJ (in short GenJ) is a viewer and editor for genealogic data stored in Gedcom format.
</p>

<a name = "2"><p>
  <b>Q</b> Is there a mailing list and/or a newsgroup devoted to GenJ ?<br>
  <b>A</b> There is no newsgroup, but two active mailing lists freely available 
    by subscription :
    <Ul>
    <li><a href="mailto:genj-user@lists.sourceforge.net">
    genj-user@lists.sourceforge.net</A> for open discussion, comments, 
    questions about GenJ.
    <li><a href="mailto:genj-developer@lists.sourceforge.net">
    genj-developer@lists.sourceforge.net</A> for development issues
    </Ul>
    If you want to subscribe to one or both of those mailing lists, 
    because you want to participate in discussion, ask questions regarding 
    GenJ, help in development, just visit  
    <a Href="http://genj.sourceforge.net" target="sf">GenJ Homepage</A> at SourceForge, and follow 
    the links.
<p>

<a name = "3"><p>
 <b>Q</b> What does Gedcom stand for?<br>
 <b>A</b> Please read the explanation <a href="./../concepts/gedcom.html">here</A>.
</p>

<a name = "4"><p>
 <b>Q</b> How do I get pictures to show up in Tree View?<br>
 <b>A</b> 
 To show a picture for every person in the main Tree view add
 a multimedia property (OBJE) to your individuals. Simply bring
 up an indivdual in <a href="../view/edit.html">Edit View</a>, choose the topmost
 property INDI, click on '+' and choose OBJE to be added.
 Point the sub-property FILE to a file in your computer's 
 file-system (button '>>') and the images will be picked up by 
 <a href="../view/tree.html">Tree View</a> (it's looking
 for INDI:OBJE:FILE automatically).
</p>

<a name = "5"><p>
 <b>Q</b> Can I change the language that GenJ speaks?<br>
 <b>A</b> 
  Please download the appropriate language pack (genj_ll-x.y.zip) for GenJ
  (e.g. genj_fr-2.0.zip) from the 
    <a target=project href="http://genj.sourceforge.net">project's homepage</a>
  and follow the instructions described to install it. 
  GenJ will try to use the language of your operating system automatically. 
  To explicitly switch to a language (the language pack has to been installed 
  manually) 
  choose menu-item <em>Help|About</em> and flip to the <em>Look&Feel</em>-Tab.
  Then select the language of choice.
</p>

<a name = "6"><p>
 <b>Q</b> Can I make a centimeter look like one on my screen?<br>
 <b>A</b> GenJ uses real-world metrics for various components (e.g. in
  <a href="../view/tree.html">Tree View</a>). To make lengths of lines and
  sizes of boxes appear correctly on your screen you'll have to tell GenJ
  about your display's resolution (which is reported by the operating system
  but normally doesn't match system's monitor). 
  To explicitly adjust the resolution 
  choose menu-item <em>Help|About</em> and flip to the <em>Look&Feel</em>-Tab. 
  Then use a ruler to match the shown rulers on your screen.
</p>

<a name = "7"><p>
 <b>Q</b> Can I change the boring gray look?<br>
 <b>A</b> GenJ uses the Swing Toolkit for presenting information to the
 user. This by default looks gray - it's called <em>Metal</em>. GenJ
 allows to change the current Look&Feel. 
 Please download the Look&Feel pack (genj_lnf-x.y.zip) from the
    <a target=project href="http://genj.sourceforge.net">project's homepage</a>
  and follow the instructions described to install it. 
  After restarting GenJ
  choose menu-item <em>Help|About</em> and flip to the <em>Look&Feel</em>-Tab. 
  Now you can select a Look&Feel (and optionally a Theme).
