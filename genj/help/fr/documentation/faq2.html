You wanted to show a picture for every person in the main Tree view.<Br>
You can do that by either:<Br>
+ adding a OBJE-property to an individual which can have a FILE
  property referring to a file or a BLOB property that includes
  the file's content (the editor will show a 'choose file'
  dialog for this)<Br>
+ select the individual so that it shows up in the Editor and
  click on the button in the lower/right corner 
  (*<A Href="./../entity/media.html">Media</A>)
  This will create a new multimedia entry that is linked to
  the individual.<Br>
The first case let's you choose that property in the tree-settings 
window so that all that shows in the entities box.
(The default Gedcom supplied with the distribution does
 that for a picture from Nils Meier btw)<Br>
<Br>

<Font color="green"> > I had done all this before but all that is 
achieved is in the "Tree View"  for a particular 
individual the following information :
OBJE @M005@</Font><Br>
Yes, that's true if you go option 1:<Br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;add a Multimedia (OBJE) instance and add a reference from the 
individual to it<Br>
Alternatively you can add a Multimedia (OBJE) property (!) to
the individual that also lets you choose the picture. This will
show up in the tree then because it's a chooseable property
of the individual INDI|OBJE|FILE or INDI|OBJE|BLOB<Br>
That's simply not good :( Normally in Gedcom a property contains
the value
<Ul>
 INDI|NAME<Br>
 INDI|SEX
</Ul>
but with special things like NOTE or OBJE it works differently
<Ul>
 INDI|NOTE          (<-- a note property with text)<Br>
 INDI|NOTE -> NOTE  (<-- a note property pointing to a note entity)<Br>
 INDI|OBJE|FILE     (<-- a obje property with the content in FILE)<Br>
 INDI|OBJE|BLOB     (<-- a obje property with the content in BLOB)
</Ul>
But
<Ul>
 INDI|OBJE -> OBJE|FILE    (<-- a obje property pointing to a obje
                            with the content in property FILE)<Br>
 INDI|OBJE -> OBJE|BLOB    (<-- a obje property pointing to a obje
                            with the content in property BLOB)
</Ul>
