You can open the Setting View window from the main window (button
on the right) or any of the views supporting it (Tree, Table or
Timeline). This view stays open until closed and displays the
advanced settings for a view selected by the user. Follow one of
the links to see what settings can be changed for one of the
shown views:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A href="settings/tree.html">Tree View's settings<A><BR>
<A href="settings/table.html">Table View's settings<A><BR>
<A href="settings/timeline.html">Timeline View's settings<A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
When changing settings for the current view you can choose to
apply the changes or to reset the changes by clicking on one
of the buttons in the lower toolbar. Close the window through
its system-menu or the close-button.
