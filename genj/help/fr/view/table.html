<BODY>
<H2>Table View</H2>

<P>
This view shows all entities (of the same type) in a
tabular fashion. You can scroll up/down and select
entities. A selection is notified to the 
<A href="edit.html">Edit View</A> which will then
show that entity's properties. Click on one of the
column headers and the whole list will be sorted by
that column - click once again and the sorting is
reversed.
</P>

<P>
Individual columns represent paths to a property of 
an entity's property-tree. The column-headers show that
path - e.g. <B>INDI:BIRT:DATE</B> stands for the date of 
the birthday-property of an individual. You'll learn
more about those <I>Tag Paths</I> in the section about
the <A href="settings/table.html">Settings View</A> and 
<A href="../special/report.html">Report Writing</A>.
</P>

<P>
The toolbar at the lower/right offers additional functionality:
<OL>
<LI>The buttons with entities' symbols choose to show either
individuals, families, medias or notes
<LI>The rightmost button opens the <A href="settings/table.html">Settings View</A>
for this view
