<H2>Timeline View</H2>

<P>
The timeline shows all events stored in a Gedcom file. An event
is a special Gedcom-property like BIRTh, DEATh, RESIdence or GRADuation.
This view puts all events on a scale starting before
the first event and ending after the last event. The events are
put into a layout from left to right (and top to bottom). Scroll
around to inspect the events that happened around a specific time.
