<H2>Report View</H2>

<P>
A Report is a Java class implementing an interface to GenJ. Reports
have to reside in the <B>./reports</B> directory and will be loaded
dynamically by GenJ. Once you open the Report View a list of all
available reports is shown. You can select from that list and a
description of the report's purpose and its author is shown on the
right.
</P>

<P>
The buttons allow to start a report, stop a running report, close
the view, save the report's output or to reload the reports in
case they have changed on disk. Mind that all reports operate on
the Gedcom file this view's been opened on.
</P>

<P>
Depending on the type of report, this view switches to the output-tab
after starting it. A report can either be of console- or window-type.
Former just writes to a simple output which is captured and shown
on that special tab (can be saved later). Latter is supposed to 
shown customized dialogs without the result in the standard-output.
