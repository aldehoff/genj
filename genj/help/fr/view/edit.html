<H2>Edit View</H2>

<P>
Gedcom suggests one file which consists of an unlimited
number of <A href="../entities.html">entities</A>. Every
entity has an unlimited number of properties which
can be nested in an unlimited number of levels.
To edit an entity therefore GenJ shows a tree of its
properties.
</P>

<P>
You can open as many Edit Views as you wish - they all
listen to events on the file they were opened on. Once
you select an entity in the Table or Tree view, it will
be shown in this one. In case you want to have one
Edit View stick to a particular entity, simply select
it in one of the other views and click on the little
symbol at the top/right. Now this view sticks to that
entity.
</P>

<P>
You can browse the property-tree by opening and closing
sub-trees and selecting individual properties. Once
selected the property is also displayed in the bottom
part - here you can edit it.
</P>

<P>
Note that there is a number of predefined editors for
specific properties. Most properties are single-line
but sometimes they have a special format. For example
NAME : its format is <B>NAME first /last/</B>.
If you select a NAME property a special editor will
appear at the bottom that allows you to edit that
information in to individual fields. If GenJ doesn't
know an editor for the selected property or the data
kept in the property is not well formatted (e.g.
a wrong date) you still can change that value with the
default editor.
</P>

<P>
A special case are also links between entities - for
example if an individual is married he is a husband
in a family. Gedcom keeps that information by adding
one property to the family and one to the individual.
The family knows the property HUSB - the husband or
WIFE - the wife.
The individual knows the property FAMS - the family
in which he/she is a spouse.
</P>

<P>
If you select a property such as HUSB, WIFE, FAMS or
FAMC an editor appears that looks different depending
on the link's state:
<OL>
<LI> valid link - a button to jump to that linked entity
<LI> broken link - a textfield to change the reference
 to a future linked entity, a button to find another
 entity to link to by text-search and a button to perform
 the link operation.
</OL>
</P>

<P>
The buttons at the top of this view allow you to
add or remove properties. This applies to the currently
selected property. You can also move properties up/down
in the current level they reside in.
</P>

<P>
When adding a property a dialog appears that allows to
choose from a number of known sub-properties (identified
by tags). Select one of the properties and a description
appears in the right window. If you need to add a property
that is not in the list, select the 2. radio button and
enter a user-defined tag. Please read about the discussion
of <A href="../gedcom.html">Gedcom</A> compliancy to
understand that this has to be done carefully.
</P>

<P>
When you select one of the know properties by choosing
the checkbox at the bottom you can tell GenJ to add the
default sub-properties, too.
</P>

<P>
The buttons at the bottom of this view can be used to
quickly grow your GEDCOM information from the currently
shown entity. There are buttons to:
<ul>
<li>Create and add a spouse
<li>Create and add a child
<li>Create and add a parent
<li>Create and attach a note
<li>Create and attach a multimedia object
</ul>
The new entity will be selected automatically so you can
enter information very quickly e.g. starting with an
individual.
