<H2>Gedcom</H2>

<P>
Gedcom is a standard for exchanging genealogic information in an electronic 
format. It is similiar to XML in it's structure but it's not quite as well defined. 
</P>

<P>
Generally all Gedcom information is hierarchically structured. An entity
(like Person, Family or Note) has several properties which in turn can
have several properties. There's no limit on the number of levels. Beside
the standard properties (like Date, Name, Sex, etc.) it is o.k. to 
come up with custom properties supporting personal needs.
</P>

<P>
Since Gedcom doesn't know the notion of closing and ending Tags (like XML)
it is based on lines of different indentation. Indentation is specified
by a number - then follows the Tag identifying the property type.
Here is an example (sub-properties are indented here for readability only):

  1 NOTE @N003@
</PRE>

<P>
Special properties have a certain format for the contained data (e.g. Name /Last Name/).
Some properties reference other entities - here the NOTE-property links to
a note in the same Gedcom file.
</P>

<P>
The power of Family Tree for Java is that it allows this nested information to
be edited in hierarchical-view way. Also all know properties are treated in a
special way, allowing for specific editing forms. Since Family Tree knows about
properties which reference other entities, it handles the referential integrity, too.
</P>

<P>
The user can specify new properties required for individual needs. Carefull thought
should be given to that though because deviation from the Gedcom standard makes
it harder to give meaning to the entered data. As shown in the section about
<A href="view/report.html">Reports</A> (agents runing on Gedcom data) they 
can be written by anyone with a Java SDK using the infrastructure GenJ provides.
But if every end-user makes up his own structure the information is harder to retrieve -
for example: Is every ADDR-property an address where someone once lived
or is it the current address? Gedcom suggest the event RESI for that purpose : it describes
the event of dwelling at a certain place for a period of time (see above). 
GenJ knows about the Gedcom standard and will suggest sub-properties to add to
properties. We'll discuss this in more detail in the section about the 
different supported <A href="entities.html">Entities</A>.
</P>

<P>
In the future someone will come up with a new standard for keeping
genealogic information (probably in XML). But setting a worldwide standard is
not easy. Therefor we should try to stick as closely to Gedcom as
possible. To say it differently : transformation into the new standard 
will be very easy if we stick to a common base right now :).
