<P>
A Note is text which can be referred by other entities.
When creating a note by clicking on <IMG src="../../images/Note.gif"></IMG>
you are asked to enter its content. Notes are by default not
linked to any entity. Afterwards you can add a NOTE property
to any entity and link it to a note by entering its id and pressing
link. 
</P>

<P>
A note according to Gedcom doesn't necessarily have properties. But
you can still add information to a note that completes your data.
Here is an example:
<PRE>
@N003@ NOTE The author of GenJ
 DATE FROM 1998 TO 2000
</PRE>
</P>
