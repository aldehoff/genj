<P>
A Media (OBJE is the corresponding tag) is an entity wrapping any 
multimeda data you can think of. 
GenJ is aware about image files and will try to display the 
information in any of the views.
When creating a media by clicking on <IMG src="../../images/Media.gif"></IMG>
you can specify a file by opening a file-chooser. The data of that file
is included in your Gedcom-file (Base64 encoded). To keep the file
small it is also possible not to choose a file at that point. Simply 
add a FILE property to the entity later that points to a file on disk.
This is an external file that has to be shipped separately.
</P>

<P>
Medias are by default not linked to any other entity. After creation you 
can add a OBJE property (yes, OBJE is the tag for a media entity and
the tag for the media property) to any entity and link it to a media 
by entering its id and pressing link. 
</P>

<P>
A media according to Gedcom has default properties - here are two
examples based on the inclusion of the data or a reference to an
external file.
