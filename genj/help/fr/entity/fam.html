<H2>Family</H2>

<P>
The second important entity is the family. It links individuals and
is handled as a separate entity to allow for cases, where one or
even both spouses are unknown.
</P>

<P>
When creating an entity by clicking on <IMG src="../../images/Fam.gif"></IMG>
GenJ asks for some key information. Then you can specify a relationship
to another entity in your file. Simply click on an individual
in the <A href="../view/tree.html">Tree View</A> or 
<A href="../view/table.html">Table View</A> and you can choose from the
radiobuttons: that individual is either a parent or child (only if not
already child in another family) in this family.
Make your selection and click on Create.
</P>

<P>
When editing a Family in the <A href="../view/edit.html">Edit View</A>
you should stick to the Gedcom standard as close as possible. A typical
family could consists of this kind of information:
<PRE>
@F001@ FAM
 WIFE @I002@
 HUSB @I001@
 MARR
  DATE 1964
  PLAC Flagstaff, USA
 CHIL @I004@
 CHIL @I005@
 CHIL @I008@
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
Just work through the properties of your families and change
their properties. When adding new properties choose from the 
predefined list or if necessary extend the schema by adding
new property-tags for special user-properties.
</P>

<P>
An important feature of Gedcom is the capability to link
entities. Families are normally not separate - they have
a husband, wife or children. Everytime you create a
new Family connected to individuals, they are linked through
properties. These properties for the families are
HUSB (the husband), WIFE (the wife) or CHIL (the child).
The properties refer to the individual by its id. You can 
explore the relationship between families and individuals
by following those links. Be careful when deleting or 
creating new links - keeping the overview of the referential 
integrity is not easy :). 
</P>

<P>
Again the example from the section about the <A href="indi.html">Individual</A>:
You have your family tree and found out that an ancestors wife's sister married
his brother. All those individuals are in your tree already! You can now create 
a new <A>family</A> for this newly discovered relationship. But then you don't
want to create a new individual - you want to link existing entities!
The solution: Select the new family for your ancestor's brother 
and add a WIFE property to it. Then change it to point to the
sister by entering her ID. Click on the link-button and a FAMS property will
automatically be added to the sister pointing back. The circle is made.
