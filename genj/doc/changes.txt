N New - B Bug fixed - I Improved - C Changed - O Open

Future

  O Merging with improved intelligence e.g.
    - Identify matching information when merging entities
    - Remove redundant information
    - Let user choose matching entities through point&click
  O Generic printing for all views
  O Printing with Title/Pagenumber/Filename/Author/GenerationPerPage
  O Global tree-file attributes (e.g. Notes)
  O A better method of assigning IDs to entities (a system that means a little bit more than randomness)
  O Searching capability (incl. regular expressions)
  O Cut/Copy/Paste for properties in the EditView
  O OBJE-FILE reference should allow to start external viewer via mouse-click
  O Configurable selection of Views in Applet
  O Reports should translate dates to a more readable format (e.g. MAR becomes March)
  O Localize Printing labels and remember print parameters
  O Wizard that asks what to do after deletion of entities (remove empty family, remove lost branch, ...)
  O Report to re-layout all entity IDs (logical numbering, format, etc.)
  O Descendants view a la http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=DESC&db=timmsc&id=I008
  O Default properties that are added to new entities should be user-defined
  O Abbreviate special dates like this: ABT 1917 > ~1917   BEF/TO 1917 > -1917   AFT/FROM 1917 > 1917-
  O some.ged.properties files should be read by CC from the same directory as the .ged-file (and saved there, too)
  O Table view for families should list all children, not just first child.
  O Merge and Verify should be reports
  O EditView should show button for 'Create New Individual' when no individual set
    (works nicely when the user has created an empty tree)
  O Improved windows placement (applet layouts views tree NW, table NE, overview S)
  O View-Menu in ControlCenter to open up views
  O Use colors to distinguish different events in TimelineView
  O When entities are selected TableView and TreeView should try to scroll and show it
  O Open URL http://host should parse http output and offer list of choices to .ged links
  O Open URL should allow basic authentication challenge/response
  O Components in EditView receive correct focus for all proxies
  O Switch between localized names for month abbrv. and long (e.g. Jan and January)
  O Following links in EditView should also change focus in TreeView and TableView
