Future

  O Extended set of entities (REPOSITORY, SOURCE, SUBMITTER)

    - Identify matching information when merging entities
    - Remove redundant information
    - Let user choose matching entities through point&click
  O Generic printing for all views
  O Printing with Title/Pagenumber/Filename/Author/GenerationPerPage
  O Global tree-file attributes (e.g. Notes)
  O A better method of assigning IDs to entities (a system that means a little bit more than randomness)
  O Find entities in tree view by text
  O Different fonts for properties in Tree
  O Cut/Copy/Paste for properties in the EditView
  O New Tool - run a command line script
  O OBJE-FILE reference should allow to start external viewer via mouse-click
  O TimelineView should use more vertical space if available to allow for more text (horizontal)
  O Configurable selection of Views in Applet
  O Reports should translate dates to a more readable format (e.g. MAR becomes March)
  O EditView/PropertySex should allow for male/female/unknown
  O Localize Print texts
  O Printing dialogs remember parameters now (e.g. margins)
  O Printing forgets about paper orientation between pages
  O Wizard that asks what to do after deletion of entities (remove empty family, remove lost branch, ...)
  O Report to re-layout all entity IDs (logical numbering, format, etc.)
  O Descendants view a la http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=DESC&db=timmsc&id=I008
  O Default properties that are added to new entities should be user-defined
