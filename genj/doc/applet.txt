GenJ - Applet HOWTO

INTRODUCTION

 There are two basic modes of how to run the GenJ applet. You can
 either provide your Gedcom information and external files (e.g.
 pictures, .properties) unzipped relative to a 'current' directory.
 Or you can zip this information and let GenJ read this information
 on the fly.

PREPARING IT (unzipped)

 Follow these steps to provide all necessary files for running GenJ
 as an applet:

  + place genj.jar + applet-unzipped.html in [directory]

  + place [file].ged, [file].ged.properties and any images into [directory]

  + adopt applet's GEDCOM-tag in applet-unzipped.html

     <param name=GEDCOM value="[file].ged">

  + make sure that the result looks like this

    ./applet-unzipped.html
    ./genj.jar
    ./file.ged
    ./file.ged.properties
    ./image1.jpg
    ./...

PREPARING IT (zipped)

  + zip [file].ged, [file].get.properties and any images into [file].zip

  + place [file].zip into [directory]

  + adopt applet's GEDCOM-tag in applet-unzipped.html

     <param name=GEDCOM value="[file].zip#[file].ged">

  + make sure that the result looks like this

    ./applet-zipped.html
    ./genj.jar
    ./file.zip

PREPARING DETAILS (optional)

  + place results of report "Applet Details" in [directory]/details

  + add applet's GEDCOM-tag in applet-xyz.html

     <param name=DETAIL value="./details">

  + make sure that the result looks like above plus

    ./...
    ./details/i001.html
    ./details/...
    ./details/imageA.jpg
    ./details/...
