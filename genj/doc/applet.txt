GenJ - Applet HOWTO

INTRODUCTION

 There are two basic modes of how to package your data
 for the GenJ applet. You can provide all your Gedcom 
 information and external files (e.g. pictures, .properties) 
 in a directory relative to the applet's HTML page.
 Alternatively you can also create an archive of all this 
 information (use zip and preserve directory structure).
 
 You can either use ./lib/genj.jar and ./lib/graph.jar 
 coming with the default distribution genj_app-x.y.zip 
 or download genj_applet-x.y.zip and use it's contained 
 smaller libraries (reduced to necessary minimum).

PREPARING APPLET FILES (unzipped)

 Follow these steps to provide all necessary files for running GenJ
 as an applet:

  + place genj.jar + graphj.jar in [directory]

  + place [file].ged + [file].ged.properties + genj.properties and any images into [directory]

  + add a HTML page that includes the following tag

   <applet 
     code="genj.applet.Applet.class" 
     width="200" height="160" 
     archive="./genj.jar, ./graphj.jar"
     alt="GenealogyJ">
    <param name="gedcom" value="./[file.ged]">
   </applet>

  + make sure that the result looks like this

    ./[your-html].html
    ./genj.jar
    ./graph.jar
    ./genj.properties
    ./file.ged
    ./file.ged.properties
    ./image1.jpg
    ./...

PREPARING APPLET FILES (zipped)

  + zip [file].ged + [file].get.properties + genj.properties and any images into [file].zip

  + place [file].zip into [directory]

  + add a HTML page that includes the following tag

   <applet 
     code="genj.applet.Applet.class" 
     width="200" 
     height="160" 
     archive="./genj.jar, ./graphj.jar"
     alt="GenealogyJ">
    <param name="gedcom" value="./[file.zip]#[file.ged]">
   </applet>

  + make sure that the result looks like this

    ./[your-html].html
    ./graph.jar
    ./genj.jar
    ./file.zip

MAKING THE APPLET SPEAK YOUR LANGUAGE

  + place the language file of choice genj_xx.jar into [directory]

  + add that jar to the Applet's HTML tag - archive attribute

   <applet 
     ...
     archive="./genj.jar, ./graphj.jar, ./genj_xx.jar"
     ...
